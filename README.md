CMSI 386: Programming Languages
===============================

Assignments from Programming Languages collaboratively completed with Zane Kansil (@AuthorOfTheSurf). We took this course during the fall semester in 2013.

###	Learning Outcomes

These learning outcomes are taken from the syllabus. Students will:

* Master some of the fundamental concepts that underlie programming language syntax and semantics through a comparative study of several languages and their features.
* Learn several new programming language features and paradigms.
* Gain the ability to study conceptual linguistic issues without being blinded by a particular language's implementation.
* Gain insight into the problem of designing new languages.

### Assignments

There were five assignments throughout the course of the semester.

#### Assignment 1: Python
#### Assignment 2: Javascript
#### Assignment 3: Go

For these first three assignments, we completed the same questions in each language to demonstrate an understanding of the different styles each language employs.

#### Assignment 4/5: Assorted principles of Programming Languages

Assignments 4 and 5 involved studying overarching concepts of programming languages. This included written responses as well as justifications for why certain paradigms are utilized in today's coding landscape.
